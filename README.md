## <a name="intro"></a>[Introduction](http://teachtogether.tech/en/index.html#s:intro)

This chapter defines book's target group - [end-user teachers](http://teachtogether.tech/en/index.html#s:intro-audience) - people with variety of technical backgrounds who aren't working primarily as teachers and have little or no background in pedagogy.

It also contains other [sources](http://teachtogether.tech/en/index.html#s:intro-instead) to read, [acknowledgments](http://teachtogether.tech/en/index.html#s:intro-acknowledgments) and introduces [exercises](http://teachtogether.tech/en/index.html#s:intro-exercises) added at the end of each chapter.

## [Mental Models and Formative Assessment](http://teachtogether.tech/en/index.html#s:models)

This chapter introduces progression of cognitive development and simplifies it to three stages:

>* [Novices](http://teachtogether.tech/en/index.html#g:novice) - don’t know what they don’t know, i.e. they don’t yet have a usable mental model of the problem domain.
>* [Competent practitioners](http://teachtogether.tech/en/index.html#g:competent-practitioner) - have a mental model that’s adequate for everyday purposes. They can do normal tasks with normal effort under normal circumstances, and have some understanding of the limits to their knowledge (i.e. they know what they don’t know).
>* [Experts](http://teachtogether.tech/en/index.html#g:expert) - have mental models that include exceptions and special cases, which allows them to handle situations that are out of the ordinary.

It also describes [mental model](http://teachtogether.tech/en/index.html#g:mental-model):

> As the name suggests, it is a simplified representation of the most important parts of some problem domain that is good enough to enable problem solving. One example is the ball-and-spring models of molecules used in high school chemistry. Atoms aren’t actually balls, and their bonds aren’t actually springs, but the model enables people to reason about chemical compounds and their reactions. A more sophisticated model of an atom has a small central ball (the nucleus) surrounded by orbiting electrons. It’s also wrong, but the extra complexity enables people to explain more and to solve more problems.

Now, teaching novices and competent practitioners is different:

* novices need to be taught mental model, so they can put facts somewhere
* competent practitioners already have mental model, so they need to fill in the gaps in their knowledge

For example a [tutorial](http://teachtogether.tech/en/index.html#g:tutorial) is better for novices, since it helps with building mental model. On the other hand, [manuals](http://teachtogether.tech/en/index.html#g:manual) deliver facts for competent practitioners.

Notice that competent practitioners don't like tutorials because it's too slow for them. Same goes for manuals - novices won't read them because they are too complex. This phenomenon is called [expertise reversal effect](http://teachtogether.tech/en/index.html#g:expertise-reversal).

Therefore it's important to determine for which group your lessons will be made.

### [Are people learning?](http://teachtogether.tech/en/index.html#s:models-formative-assessment)

It is pointed out that students learn the fastest when their misconceptions are being identified and cleared when delivering lessons. These misconceptions fall into three categories:

>* Factual errors - like believing that Vancouver is the capital of British Columbia (it’s Victoria). These are usually simple to correct.
>* Broken models - like believing that motion and acceleration must be in the same direction. We can address these by having novices reason through examples where their models give the wrong answer.
>* Fundamental beliefs - such as “the world is only a few thousand years old”. These errors are often deeply connected to the learner’s social identity, so they resist evidence and rationalize contradictions.

This is where [formative assessment](http://teachtogether.tech/en/index.html#g:formative-assessment) comes into play. It takes place during a lesson and it gives feedback for both teacher and learner. It shouldn't break the flow of lesson while having unambiguous correct answer.

One kind of formative assessment is multiple choice question (MCQ). For example when teaching multi-digit addition:

>What is 37 + 15?
>
>a) 52
>
>b) 42
>
>c) 412
>
>d) 43

Obviously the answer is 52, but you can see that wrong answers are not accidental and each of them shows different kind of mistake when learner chooses it.

>Each of these incorrect answers is a [plausible distractor](http://teachtogether.tech/en/index.html#g:plausible-distractor) with [diagnostic power](http://teachtogether.tech/en/index.html#g:diagnostic-power). A distractor is a wrong or less-than-best answer; “plausible” means that it looks like it could be right, while “diagnostic power” means that each of the distractors helps the teacher figure out what to explain next to that particular learner.

Answers from assessments give an indication of whether the teacher should move on or stop and explain some topics again (note it is more effective to re-explain topic in different way than before).

Designing formative assessments also helps teacher with preparing lessons, covering most most likely gaps or errors. You can also use them before lesson starts - if all learners answer correctly, you can skip explaining things they already know. It is kind of [active teaching](http://teachtogether.tech/en/index.html#g:active-teaching).

### [Notional Machines](http://teachtogether.tech/en/index.html#s:models-notional)

Notional machines are things you want to teach your learners.

>A notional machine:
>
>* is an idealized abstraction of computer hardware and other aspects of programs’ runtime environments;
>* enables the semantics of programs to be described; and
>* correctly reflects what programs do when executed.

Author also provides an [example](http://teachtogether.tech/en/index.html#s:models-notional), if you need one.

## [Expertise and memory](http://teachtogether.tech/en/index.html#s:memory)

This chapter starts from describing who expert is. It gives us this metaphor:

>Imagine for a moment that we store knowledge as a network or graph in which facts are nodes and relationships are arcs. The key difference between experts and competent practitioners is that experts’ mental models are much more densely connected, i.e. they are more likely to know a connection between any two facts.

We can observe specific behavior for experts:

* Experts can often jump directly from a problem to a solution because there actually is a direct link between the two in their mind ([intuition](http://teachtogether.tech/en/index.html#g:intuition)).
* Densely-connected graphs are also the basis for experts’ [fluid representations](http://teachtogether.tech/en/index.html#g:fluid-representation), i.e. their ability to switch back and forth between different views of a problem.
* More linkages between facts makes it easier to reason backward from symptoms to causes.
* Finally, experts are often so familiar with their subject that they can no longer imagine what it’s like to not see the world that way.

The last of these points is called [expert blind spot](http://teachtogether.tech/en/index.html#g:expert-blind-spot).

### [Concept Maps](http://teachtogether.tech/en/index.html#s:memory-concept-maps)

>Our tool of choice for representing someone’s mental model is a [concept map](http://teachtogether.tech/en/index.html#g:concept-map), in which facts are bubbles and connections are labeled connections.

You could see example in previous chapter [review](#review).

>Concept maps can be used in many ways:
>
>* Helping teachers figure out what they’re trying to teach.
>* Aiding communication between lesson designers.
>* Aiding communication with learners.
>* For assessment.

There are other ways to represent mental models e.g. Venn diagrams, flowcharts and decision trees. All of these [externalize cognition](http://teachtogether.tech/en/index.html#g:externalized-cognition).

### [Seven Plus or Minus Two](http://teachtogether.tech/en/index.html#s:memory-seven-plus-or-minus)

Human memory can be divided into two layers:

* [long-term](http://teachtogether.tech/en/index.html#g:long-term-memory) (persistent) memory - its capacity is essentially unlimited, but it is slow to access
* [short-term](http://teachtogether.tech/en/index.html#g:short-term-memory) (working) memory - faster, but smaller

In [1956, Miller, George A.](http://teachtogether.tech/en/index.html#ref-Mill1956) estimated that the average adult's working memory could only hold 7±2 items at a time. 7±2 number is very important because an information to be stored in long-term memory must be first held and rehearsed in short-term memory.

This is why you shouldn't overload learners with information. Also, this is where concept map comes in handy: teacher can pick subsection from it (which fills working memory) and lead to a formative assessment.

![concept map](img/photosynthesis.png)

Using concept maps in lesson design

### [Becoming an Expert](http://teachtogether.tech/en/index.html#s:memory-becoming-expert)

To become an expert it is important to pay attention to what we do and getting feedback from our work so then in response to it we can change our behavior to get cumulatively better. It's called [deliberate](http://teachtogether.tech/en/index.html#g:deliberate-practice) or reflective practice and there are three stages of it:

* Act on feedback from others.
* Give feedback on other's work.
* Give feedback to ourselves.

## [Cognitive Architecture](http://teachtogether.tech/en/index.html#s:architecture)

This chapter digs a bit into what brains do when learning and how we can use it to our advantages.

### [What’s Going On In There?](http://teachtogether.tech/en/index.html#s:architecture-brain)

![Cognitive architecture](img/cognitive-architecture.png)

The figure above is a simplified model of human cognitive architecture. It separates short-term and long-term memories and shows that our brain can move information between them.

>Information gets into short-term memory primarily through your verbal channel (for speech) and visual channel (for images). Most people rely primarily on their visual channel, but when images and words complement each other, the brain does a better job of remembering them both: they are encoded together, so recall of one later on helps trigger recall of the other.

Therefore it is better to present information in both channels. Be wary though, as the information from channels should be complementing each other, otherwise it becomes redundant and [split-attention effect](http://teachtogether.tech/en/index.html#g:split-attention-effect) takes place. For example when watching video with both voiceover and subtitles, our brain has to put some effort into checking if both of them agree with each other.

### [Cognitive Load](http://teachtogether.tech/en/index.html#s:architecture-load)

It is more effective to teach by showing how to do things step by step than giving learners option to use their own initiative to solve problems (known as [inquiry-based learning](http://teachtogether.tech/en/index.html#g:inquiry-based-learning)).

[Cognitive load theory](http://teachtogether.tech/en/index.html#g:cognitive-load) tells us that when learning people have to deal with three things:

* [Intrinsic load](http://teachtogether.tech/en/index.html#g:intrinsic-load) is what people have to keep in mind in order to absorb new material.
* [Germane Load](http://teachtogether.tech/en/index.html#g:germane-load) is the (desirable) mental effort required to link new information to old, which is one of the things that distinguishes learning from memorization.
* [Extraneous Load](http://teachtogether.tech/en/index.html#g:extraneous-load) is anything that distracts from learning.

>Cognitive load theory holds that people have to divide a fixed amount of working memory between these three things. Our goal as teachers is to maximize the memory available to handle intrinsic load, which means reducing the germane load at each step and eliminating the extraneous load.

[Parsons problem](http://teachtogether.tech/en/index.html#g:parsons-problem) is an assessment technique which does that. When programming, instead of writing entire program from scratch, give learners lines of code which are enough to solve to problem, but need to be put in order. This makes them focus on control flow and data dependencies without being distracted by variable naming, etc.

>Another type of exercise that can be explained in terms of cognitive load is to give learners a series of [faded examples](http://teachtogether.tech/en/index.html#g:faded-example). The first example in a series presents a complete use of a particular problem-solving strategy. The next problem is of the same type, but has some gaps for the learner to fill in. Each successive problem gives the learner less [scaffolding](http://teachtogether.tech/en/index.html#g:scaffolding), until they are asked to solve a complete problem from scratch.

For example starting from complete solution in python:

```python
# total_length(["red", "green", "blue"]) => 12
define total_length(list_of_words):
    total = 0
    for word in list_of_words:
        total = total + length(word)
    return total
```

then:

```python
# word_lengths(["red", "green", "blue"]) => [3, 5, 4]
define word_lengths(list_of_words):
    list_of_lengths = []
    for ____ in ____:
        append(list_of_lengths, ____)
    return list_of_lengths
```

and:

```python
# join_all(["red", "green", "blue"]) => "redgreenblue"
define join_all(list_of_words):
    joined_words = ____
    for ____ in ____:
        ____
    return joined_words
```

finally:

```python
# make_acronym(["red", "green", "blue"]) => "RGB"
define make_acronym(list_of_words):
    ____
```

Faded examples work because they introduce the problem-solving strategy piece by piece: at each step, learners have one new problem to tackle. When constructing them it's important to think about the problem-solving strategy it is meant to teach.

[Labeling subgoals](http://teachtogether.tech/en/index.html#g:subgoal-labeling) means giving names to the steps in a step-by-step description of a problem-solving process. From previous python example we can name subgoals as follows:

1. Create an empty value of the type to be returned.
2. Get the value to be added to the result from the loop variable.
3. Update the result with that value.

>Labeling subgoals works because grouping related steps into named chunks helps learners distinguish what’s generic from what is specific to the problem at hand. It also helps them build a mental model of that kind of problem so that they can solve other problems of that kind, and gives them a natural opportunity for self-explanation.

### [Other Models of Learning](http://teachtogether.tech/en/index.html#s:architecture-theory)

>Two specific perspectives from [educational psychology](http://teachtogether.tech/en/index.html#g:educational-psychology) have influenced this book. The one we have used so far is [cognitivism](http://teachtogether.tech/en/index.html#g:cognitivism), which focuses on things like pattern recognition, memory formation, and recall. It is good at answering low-level questions, but generally ignores larger issues like, “What do we mean by ‘learning’?” and, “Who gets to decide?” The other is [situated learning](http://teachtogether.tech/en/index.html#g:situated-learning), which focuses on bringing people into a community and recognizes that teaching and learning are always rooted in who we are and who we aspire to be.

Besides cognitivism we have other perspectives like:

* [behaviorism](http://teachtogether.tech/en/index.html#g:behaviorism), which treats education as stimulus/response conditioning
* [constructivism](http://teachtogether.tech/en/index.html#g:constructivism), which considers learning an active process during which learners construct knowledge for themselves
* [connectivism](http://teachtogether.tech/en/index.html#g:connectivism), which holds that knowledge is distributed, that learning is the process of navigating, growing, and pruning connections, and which emphasizes the social aspects of learning made possible by the internet

### [Review](http://teachtogether.tech/en/index.html#review-1)

![Cognitive load](img/conceptmap-cognitive-load.png)

## [Individual Learning](http://teachtogether.tech/en/index.html#s:individual)

This chapter focuses on learners instead of teachers - what they can do for themselves.

The most effective strategy is to switch from [passive learning](http://teachtogether.tech/en/index.html#g:passive-learning) to [active learning](http://teachtogether.tech/en/index.html#g:active-learning).

Passive | Active
:-------|:--------
Read about something | Do exercises
Watch a video | Discuss a topic
Attend a lecture | Try to explain it

Active learning keeps new information in short-term memory longer as well as strengthen ties between that information and what they already know.

Other thing is [metacognition](http://teachtogether.tech/en/index.html#g:metacognition) (thinking about one's own thinking), which means making plans, setting goals and monitoring their progress.

>The big prize is [transfer of learning](http://teachtogether.tech/en/index.html#g:transfer-of-learning), which occurs when one thing we have learned helps us learn other things more quickly. Researchers distinguish between [near transfer](http://teachtogether.tech/en/index.html#g:near-transfer), which occurs between similar or related areas like fractions and decimals in mathematics, and [far transfer](http://teachtogether.tech/en/index.html#g:far-transfer), which occurs between dissimilar domains—for example, the idea that learning to play chess will help mathematical reasoning or vice versa (though in practice it rarely occures).

### [Six Strategies](http://teachtogether.tech/en/index.html#s:individual-strategies)

The [Learning Scientists](https://www.learningscientists.org/) have catalogued six of these strategies and summarized them in a set of [downloadable posters](https://www.learningscientists.org/downloadable-materials).

#### Spaced Practice

The basic idea is to spread studying activity over time: block off at least half an hour to study each topic each day rather than trying to cram everything in the night before an exam.

Also review material after each class (while mixing up some older material), and note things that you have forgotten from it.

#### Retrieval Practice

>The limiting factor for long-term memory is not retention (what is stored) but recall (what can be accessed). Recall of specific information improves with practice, so outcomes in real situations can be improved by taking practice tests or summarizing the details of a topic from memory and then checking what was and wasn’t remembered.

Recall is better when practice uses activities similar to those used in testing. This phenomenon is called [transfer-appropriate processing](http://teachtogether.tech/en/index.html#g:transfer-appropriate-processing).

To improve retrieval skills you can:

* solve problems twice - first time entirely from memory, then with resources
* make flash cards - it is a card that has question on one side and answer on the other
* use [read-cover-retrieve](http://teachtogether.tech/en/index.html#g:read-cover-retrieve) method - when reading something, cover some definitions or terms with sticky notes, then try to guess it before uncovering

#### Interleaving

This method consists of shuffling study sessions instead of mastering subjects one by one. For example learning topics in order A-B-C-B-A-C is better than A-B-C-A-B-C which is also better than A-A-B-B-C-C.

#### Elaboration

The idea is to explain things to yourself which helps you understand and remember them.

One way to do this is to follow up each answer on a practice quiz with an explanation of why that answer is correct, or conversely with an explanation of why some other plausible answer isn’t.

#### Concrete Examples

You can use concrete examples i.e. whenever you have a statement of a general principle, try to provide one or more examples of its use, or conversely take each particular problem and list the general principles it embodies.

>One structured way to do this is the [ADEPT](https://betterexplained.com/articles/adept-method/) method: give an **A**nalogy, draw a **D**iagram, present an **E**xample, describe the idea in **P**lain language, and then give the **T**echnical details.

You can also teach by contrast i.e. to show learners what a solution is not or what kind of problem a technique won’t solve.

#### Dual Coding

The last strategy is to present words and images together. If complementary information is presented through both verbal and visual channels, they can reinforce each other.

>One way to take advantage of dual coding is to draw or label timelines, maps, family trees, or whatever else seems appropriate to the material.

### Time Management

Some facts:

1. Working more than 8 hours a day for an extended period of time lowers your total productivity, not just your hourly productivity — i.e. you get less done in total (not just per hour) when you’re in crunch mode.
2. Working over 21 hours in a stretch increases the odds of you making a catastrophic error just as much as being legally drunk.
3. Productivity varies over the course of the workday, with the greatest productivity occurring in the first 4 to 6 hours. After enough hours, productivity approaches zero; eventually it becomes negative.

Overall, it is very ineffective to work for very long time or to pull an all-nighter. *People usually don't notice their abilities declining*. For example, ability to think drops by 25% for each 24 hours you are awake.

One widely-used technique which helps to be productive is to make a list of things that need to be done, then sort them by priority, and then switch off email and other interruptions for 30-60 minutes and complete one of those tasks (you can break down bigger tasks into smaller pieces).

>The most important part of this is switching off interruptions. Despite what many people want to believe, human beings are not good at multi-tasking. What we can become good at is [automaticity](http://teachtogether.tech/en/index.html#g:automaticity), which is the ability to do something routine in the background while doing something else.

The point of organizing and preparing is to get into the most productive mental state possible (it's called [flow](http://teachtogether.tech/en/index.html#g:flow)). It takes roughly 10 minutes to get back into this state after an interruption, no matter how short the interruption was.

### [Peer Assessment](http://teachtogether.tech/en/index.html#s:individual-peer)

One way to implement peer assessment is [contributing student pedagogy](http://teachtogether.tech/en/index.html#g:contributing-student), in which learners produce artifacts to contribute to others’ learning. This can be developing a short lesson and sharing it with the class, adding to a question bank, or writing up notes from a particular lecture for in-class publication.

Another approach is [calibrated peer review](http://teachtogether.tech/en/index.html#g:calibrated-peer-review), in which a learner reviews one or more examples using a rubric and compares their evaluation against the teacher’s review of the same work. Once learners’ evaluations are close enough to the teacher’s, they start evaluating their peers’ actual work. If several peers’ assessments are combined, this can be as accurate as assessment by teachers.

### [Review](http://teachtogether.tech/en/index.html#review-2)

![Active learning](img/conceptmap-active-learning.png)

## [A Lesson Design Process](http://teachtogether.tech/en/index.html#s:process)

[Backward design](http://teachtogether.tech/en/index.html#g:backward-design) is a method that works very well for lesson design. In simplified form, its steps are:

1. Create or recycle learner personas (discussed in the next section) to figure out who you are trying to help and what will appeal to them.
2. Brainstorm to get a rough idea of what you want to cover, how you’re going to do it, what problems or misconceptions you expect to encounter, what’s not going to be included, and so on. Drawing concept maps can help a lot at this stage.
3. Create a summative assessment to define your overall goal. This can be the final exam for a course or the capstone project for a one-day workshop; regardless of its form or size, it shows how far you hope to get more clearly than a point-form list of objectives.
4. Create formative assessments that will give people a chance to practice the things they’re learning. These will also tell you (and them) whether they’re making progress and where they need to focus their attention. The best way to do this is to itemize the knowledge and skills used in the summative assessment you developed in the previous step and then create at least one formative assessment for each.
5. Order the formative assessments to create a course outline based on their complexity, their dependencies, and how well topics will motivate your learners.
6. Write material to get learners from one formative assessment to the next. Each hour of instruction should consist of three to five such episodes.
7. Write a summary description of the course to help its intended audience find it and figure out whether it’s right for them.

This method helps keep teaching focused on its objectives. It also ensures that learners don’t face anything at the end of the course that they are not prepared for.

### [Learner Personas](http://teachtogether.tech/en/index.html#s:process-personas)

A learner persona consists of:

1. the person’s general background;
2. what they already know;
3. what they want to do; and
4. any special needs they have.

For example a learner persona for a volunteer group that runs weekend Python workshops might be:

1. Jorge just moved from Costa Rica to Canada to study agricultural engineering. He has joined the college soccer team and is looking forward to learning how to play ice hockey.
2. Other than using Excel, Word, and the internet, Jorge’s most significant previous experience with computers is helping his sister build a WordPress site for the family business back home.
3. Jorge wants to measure properties of soil from nearby farms using a handheld device that sends data to his computer. Right now he has to open each data file in Excel, delete the first and last column, and calculate some statistics on what’s left. He has to collect at least 600 measurements in the next few months, and really doesn’t want to have to do these steps by hand for each one.
4. Jorge can read English well, but sometimes struggles to keep up with spoken conversation that involves a lot of jargon.

>Personas should always describe what the learner wants to do rather than what you think they actually need. Ask yourself what they are searching for online; it probably won’t include jargon that they don’t yet know, so part of what you have to do as an instructional designer is figure out how to make your lesson findable.

### [Learning Objectives](http://teachtogether.tech/en/index.html#s:process-objectives)

>A [learning objective](http://teachtogether.tech/en/index.html#g:learning-objective) is what a lesson strives to achieve. A [learning outcome](http://teachtogether.tech/en/index.html#g:learning-outcome) is what it actually achieves, i.e. what learners actually take away. The role of summative assessment is therefore to compare learning outcomes with learning objectives.

A learning objective describes how the learner will demonstrate what they have learned once they have successfully completed a lesson. More specifically, it has a measurable or verifiable verb that states what the learner will do and specifies the criteria for acceptable performance.

One way to understand what makes for a good learning objective is to see how a poor one can be improved:

* The learner will be given opportunities to learn good programming practices.
  * This describes the lesson’s content, not the attributes of successful learners.
* The learner will have a better appreciation for good programming practices.
  * This doesn’t start with an active verb or define the level of learning, and the subject of learning has no context and is not specific.
* The learner will understand how to program in R.
  * While this starts with an active verb, it doesn’t define the level of learning and the subject of learning is still too vague for assessment.
* The learner will write one-page data analysis scripts to read, filter, and summarize tabular data using R.
  * This starts with an active verb, defines the level of learning, and provides context to ensure that outcomes can be assessed.

When it comes to choosing verbs, many teachers use [Bloom's Taxonomy](http://teachtogether.tech/en/index.html#g:blooms-taxonomy). It has six categories, each providing verbs used in learning objectives:

* **Remembering:** Exhibit memory of previously learned material by recalling facts, terms, basic concepts, and answers. (recognize, list, describe, name, find)
* **Understanding:** Demonstrate understanding of facts and ideas by organizing, comparing, translating, interpreting, giving descriptions, and stating main ideas. (interpret, summarize, paraphrase, classify, explain)
* **Applying:** Solve new problems by applying acquired knowledge, facts, techniques and rules in a different way. (build, identify, use, plan, select)
* **Analyzing:** Examine and break information into parts by identifying motives or causes; make inferences and find evidence to support generalizations. (compare, contrast, simplify)
* **Evaluating:** Present and defend opinions by making judgments about information, validity of ideas, or quality of work based on a set of criteria. (check, choose, critique, prove, rate)
* **Creating:** Compile information together in a different way by combining elements in a new pattern or proposing alternative solutions. (design, construct, improve, adapt, maximize, solve)

There is also [Fink's Taxonomy](http://teachtogether.tech/en/index.html#g:finks-taxonomy):

* **Foundational Knowledge:** understanding and remembering information and ideas. (remember, understand, identify)
* **Application:** skills, critical thinking, managing projects. (use, solve, calculate, create)
* **Integration:** connecting ideas, learning experiences, and real life. (connect, relate, compare)
* **Human Dimension:** learning about oneself and others. (come to see themselves as, understand others in terms of, decide to become)
* **Caring:** developing new feelings, interests, and values. (get excited about, be ready to, value)
* **Learning How to Learn:** becoming a better learner. (identify source of information for, frame useful questions about)

### [Maintainability](http://teachtogether.tech/en/index.html#s:process-maintainability)

A lesson is maintainable when it is cheaper to update it than to replace it. It depends on four factors:

* How well documented the course’s design is - if the person doing maintenance doesn’t know (or doesn’t remember) what the lesson is supposed to accomplish or why topics are introduced in a particular order, it will take them more time to update it.
* How easy it is for collaborators to collaborate technically.
* How willing people are to collaborate.
* How useful sharing actually is - the [Reusability Paradox](http://teachtogether.tech/en/index.html#g:reusability-paradox) states that the more reusable a learning object is, the less pedagogically effective it is. Direct re-use may therefore be the wrong goal for lessons; we might get further by trying to make them easier to remix.

## [Pedagogical Content Knowledge](http://teachtogether.tech/en/index.html#s:pck)

Every teacher needs three things:

* [**content knowledge**](http://teachtogether.tech/en/index.html#g:content-knowledge) such as how to program;
* [**general pedagogical knowledge**](http://teachtogether.tech/en/index.html#g:general-pedagogical-knowledge) such as an understanding of the psychology of learning; and
* [**pedagogical content knowledge**](http://teachtogether.tech/en/index.html#g:pedagogical-content-knowledge) (PCK), which is the domain-specific knowledge of how to teach a particular concept to a particular audience. In computing, PCK includes things like what examples to use when teaching how parameters are passed to a function or what misconceptions about nesting HTML tags are most common.

>As with all research, some caution is required when interpreting results:
>
>* Theories change as more data becomes available.
>* Most of these studies’ subjects are WEIRD:
they are from Western, Education, Industrialized, Rich, and Democratic societies
>
>If this was an academic treatise, I would therefore preface most claims with qualifiers like, “Some research may seem to indicate that…” But since actual teachers in actual classrooms have to make decisions regardless of whether research has clear answers yet or not, this chapter presents actionable best guesses rather than nuanced perhapses.

### [What Are We Teaching Them Now?](http://teachtogether.tech/en/index.html#s:pck-now)

Very little is known about what coding bootcamps and other free-range initiatives teach, in part because many are reluctant to share their curriculum. We know more about what is taught by institution:

Topic|%|Topic|%
:---|:---|:---|:---
Programming Process|87%|Data Types|23%
Abstract Programming Thinking|63%|Input/Output|17%
Data Structures|40%|Libraries|15%
Object-Oriented Concepts|36%|Variables & Assignment|14%
Control Structures|33%|Recursion|10%
Operations & Functions|26%|Pointers & Memory Management|5%

### [How Much Are They Learning](http://teachtogether.tech/en/index.html#s:pck-learning)

In short, measure and track results (of your learners) in ways that can be compared over time so that you can tell if your lessons are becoming more or less effective.

### [What Misconceptions Do Novices Have?](http://teachtogether.tech/en/index.html#s:pck-misunderstand)

The biggest misconception novices have — sometimes called the “superbug” in coding — is the belief that computers understand what people mean in the way that another human being would.

An example of a misconception is:

```python
grade = 65
total = grade + 10
grade = 80
print(total)
```

After this code, some incorrectly believe that the value of `total` will be 90 rather than 75. Other misconceptions inclue:

* A variable holds the history of the values it has been assigned, i.e. it remembers what its value used to be.
* Two objects with the same value for a `name` or `id` attribute are guaranteed to be the same object.
* Functions are executed as they are defined, or are executed in the order in which they are defined.
* A `while` loop’s condition is constantly evaluated, and the loop stops as soon as it becomes false. Conversely, the conditions in `if` statements are also constantly evaluated, and their statements are executed as soon as the condition becomes true regardless of where the flow of control is at the time.
* Assignment moves values, i.e. after `a = b`, the variable `b` is empty.

### [What Mistakes Do Novices Make?](http://teachtogether.tech/en/index.html#s:pck-mistakes)

>The mistakes novices make can tell us what to prioritize in our teaching, but it turns out that most teachers don’t know how common different kinds of mistakes actually are. The largest study of this is, [[Brow2017](http://teachtogether.tech/en/index.html#ref-Brow2017)] which found that mismatched quotes and parentheses are the most common type of errors in novice Java programs, but also the easiest to fix, while some mistakes (like putting the condition of an `if` in `{}` instead of `()`) are most often made only once. Unsurprisingly, mistakes that produce compiler errors are fixed much faster than ones that don’t. Some mistakes, however, are made many times, like invoking methods with the wrong arguments (e.g. passing a string instead of an integer).

### [How Do Novices Program?](http://teachtogether.tech/en/index.html#s:pck-programming)

Recent work has shown the effectiveness of teaching four distinct skills in a specific order:


||semantics of code|templates related to goals
:---|:---|:---
reading|1. read code and predict behavior|3. recognize templates and their uses
writing|2. write correct syntax|4. use templates to meet goals

Our next recommendations are therefore to have learners read code, then modify it, then write it, and to introduce common patterns explicitly and have learners practice using them.

### [How Do Novices Debug?](http://teachtogether.tech/en/index.html#s:pck-debug)

[[List2004](http://teachtogether.tech/en/index.html#ref-List2004),[List2009](http://teachtogether.tech/en/index.html#ref-List2009)] found that many novices struggled to predict the output of short pieces of code and to select the correct completion of the code from a set of possibilities when told what it was supposed to do.

Our fifth recommendation is therefore to explicitly teach novices how to debug. [[Fitz2008](http://teachtogether.tech/en/index.html#ref-Fitz2008),[Murp2008](http://teachtogether.tech/en/index.html#ref-Murp2008)] found that good debuggers were good programmers, but not all good programmers were good at debugging. Those who were used a symbolic debugger to step through their programs, traced execution by hand, wrote tests, and re-read the spec frequently, which are all teachable habits. However, tracing execution step by step was sometimes used ineffectively: for example, a novice might put the same `print` statement in both parts of an `if-else`. Novices would also comment out lines that were actually correct as they tried to isolate a problem; teachers can make both of these mistakes deliberately, point them out, and correct them to help novices get past them.

* Teaching novices how to debug can also help make classes easier to manage.
* Debugging depends on being able to read code, which multiple studies have shown is the single most effective way to find bugs.
* Having learners predict a program’s output just before it is run, on the other hand, helps reinforce learning and also gives them a natural moment to ask “what if” questions.

### [What About Testing?](http://teachtogether.tech/en/index.html#s:pck-testing)

[[Bria2015](http://teachtogether.tech/en/index.html#ref-Bria2015)] found that novices’ tests often have low coverage (i.e. they don’t test most of the code) and that they often test many things at once, which makes it hard to pinpoint the causes of errors.

Another study [[Edwa2014b](http://teachtogether.tech/en/index.html#ref-Edwa2014b)] found that novices’ tests only detected an average of 13.6% of the faults present in the entire program population. What’s more, 90% of the novices’ tests were very similar, which indicates that novices mostly write tests to confirm that code is doing what it’s supposed to rather than to find cases where it isn’t.

One approach to teaching better testing practices is to define a programming problem by providing a set of tests to be passed rather than through a written description. Before doing this, though, take a moment to look at how many tests you’ve written for your own code recently, and then decide whether you’re teaching what you believe people should do, or what they (and you) actually do.

### [Do Languages Matter?](http://teachtogether.tech/en/index.html#s:pck-language)

The short answer is “yes”: novices learn to program faster and learn more using blocks-based tools like Scratch [[Wein2017](http://teachtogether.tech/en/index.html#ref-Wein2017)]. One reason is that blocks-based systems reduce cognitive load by eliminating the possibility of syntax errors.

But what happens after blocks?[[Chen2018](http://teachtogether.tech/en/index.html#ref-Chen2018)] found that learners whose first programming language was graphical had higher grades in introductory programming courses than learners whose first language was textual when the languages were introduced in or before early adolescent years. Our sixth recommendation is therefore to start children and teens with blocks-based interfaces before moving to text-based systems. The age qualification is there because Scratch deliberately looks like it’s meant for younger users, and it can still be hard to convince adults to take it seriously.

#### Object-Oriented Programming

Introducing objects early has a few challenges.[[Mill2016b](http://teachtogether.tech/en/index.html#ref-Mill2016b)] found that most novices using Python struggled to understand self (which refers to the current object): they omitted it in method definitions, failed to use it when referencing object attributes, or both.[[Rago2017](http://teachtogether.tech/en/index.html#ref-Rago2017)] found something similar in high school students, and also found that high school teachers often weren’t clear on the concept either. On balance, we recommend that teachers start with functions rather than objects, i.e. that learners not be taught how to define classes until they understand basic control structures and data types.

#### Type Declarations

[[Endr2014](http://teachtogether.tech/en/index.html#ref-Endr2014),[Fisc2015](http://teachtogether.tech/en/index.html#ref-Fisc2015)] found that requiring novices to declare variable types does add some complexity to programs, but it pays off fairly quickly by acting as documentation for a method’s use — in particular, by forestalling questions about what’s available and how to use it.

#### Variable Naming

[[Bink2012](http://teachtogether.tech/en/index.html#ref-Bink2012)] reported that reading and understanding code is fundamentally different from reading prose:

>“…the more formal structure and syntax of source code allows programmers to assimilate and comprehend parts of the code quite rapidly independent of style. In particular…beacons and program plans play a large role in comprehension.”

It also found that experienced developers are relatively unaffected by identifier style, so our recommendation is just to use consistent style in all examples. Since most languages have style guides (e.g. [PEP 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) for Python) and tools to check that code follows these guidelines, our full recommendation is to use tools to ensure that all code examples adhere to a consistent style.

### [Do Better Error Messages Help?](http://teachtogether.tech/en/index.html#s:pck-error)

Incomprehensible error messages are a major source of frustration for novices (and for experienced programmers as well).

[[Bari2017](http://teachtogether.tech/en/index.html#ref-Bari2017)] used eye tracking to show that despite the grumblings of compiler writers, people really do read error messages — in fact, they spend 13–25% of their time doing this. However, reading error messages turns out to be as difficult as reading source code, and how difficult it is to read the error messages strongly predicts task performance. Teachers should therefore show learners how to read and interpret error messages.

#### Does Visualization Help?

To answer this,[[Cunn2017](http://teachtogether.tech/en/index.html#ref-Cunn2017)] replicated an earlier study of the kinds of sketching learners do when tracing code execution. They found that not sketching at all correlates with lower success, while tracing changes to variables’ values by writing new values near their names as they change was the most effective strategy.

Our recommendation is therefore to teach learners to trace variables’ values when debugging.

### [What Else Can We Do To Help?](http://teachtogether.tech/en/index.html#s:pck-help)

As a teacher, you can do ten things to improve outcomes:

* **Collaboration:** Activities that encourage learner collaboration either in classrooms or labs.
* **Content Change:** Parts of the teaching material were changed or updated.
* **Contextualization:** Course content and activities were aligned towards a specific context such as games or media.
* [**CS0:**](http://teachtogether.tech/en/index.html#g:cs0) Creation of a preliminary course to be taken before the introductory programming course; could be organized only for some (e.g. at-risk) learners.
* **Game Theme:** A game-themed component was introduced to the course.
* **Grading Scheme:** A change in the grading scheme, such as increasing the weight of programming activities while reducing that of the exam.
* **Group Work:** Activities with increased group work commitment such as team-based learning and cooperative learning.
* **Media Computation:** Activities explicitly declaring the use of media computation.
* **Peer Support:** Support by peers in form of pairs, groups, hired peer mentors or tutors.
* **Other Support:** An umbrella term for all support activities, e.g. increased teacher hours, additional support channels, etc.

### [Where Next?](http://teachtogether.tech/en/index.html#s:pck-final)

### [Exercises](http://teachtogether.tech/en/index.html#s:pck-exercises)

## [Teaching as a Performance Art](http://teachtogether.tech/en/index.html#s:performance)

You may give your learners both written lessons and some combination of recorded video and self-paced exercises, but if you are going to teach in person you must offer something different from (and hopefully better than) either of them. This chapter therefore focuses on how to teach programming by actually doing it.

### [Live Coding](http://teachtogether.tech/en/index.html#s:performance-live)

The most effective way to teach programming is [live coding](http://teachtogether.tech/en/index.html#g:live-coding) for several reasons:

* It enables [active teaching](http://teachtogether.tech/en/index.html#g:active-teaching) by allowing teachers to follow their learners’ interests and questions in the moment.
* Watching a program being written is more motivating than watching someone page through slides.
* It facilitates unintended knowledge transfer: people learn more than we are consciously teaching by watching how we do things.
* It slows the teacher down: if they have to type in the program as they go along then they can only go twice as fast as their learners rather than ten times faster as they could with slides.
* It helps reduce the load on short-term memory because it makes the teacher more aware of how much they are throwing at their learners.
* Learners get to see how to diagnose and correct mistakes.
* Watching teachers make mistakes shows learners that it’s all right to make mistakes of their own.

Live coding also demonstrates the order in which programs should be written and gives teachers a chance to emphasize the importance of small steps with frequent feedback.

It takes a bit of practice to get comfortable talking while you code in front of an audience. The sections below offer tips on how to make your live coding better.

#### Embrace Your Mistakes

The most important rule of live coding is to embrace your mistakes. No matter how well you prepare, you will make some; when you do, think through them with your audience.

#### Ask For Predictions

One way to keep learners engaged while you are live coding is to ask them to make predictions about what the code on the screen is going to do. You can then write down the first few suggestions they make, have the whole class vote on which they think is most likely, and then run the code.

#### Take It Slow

Every time you type a command, add a line of code to a program, or select an item from a menu, say what you are doing out loud and then point to what you have done and its output on the screen and go through it a second time.

>Whatever you do, don’t copy and paste code: doing this practically guarantees that you’ll race ahead of your learners. And if you use tab completion, say it out loud so that your learners understand what you’re doing: “Let’s use turtle dot ‘r’ ‘i’ and tab to get ‘right’.”

#### Be Seen And Heard

When you sit down, you are more likely to look at your screen rather than at your audience and may be hidden from learners in the back rows of your classroom. Plan for this and make sure that you have a raised table, standing desk, or lectern for your laptop so that you don’t have to bend over to type.

Regardless of whether you are standing or sitting, make sure to move around as much as you can: go to the screen to point something out, draw something on the whiteboard, or just step away from your computer for a few moments and speak directly to your audience.

If you are going to be teaching for more than a couple of hours, it’s worth using a microphone even in a small room.

#### Mirror Your Learner's Environment

You may have customized your environment with a fancy Unix shell prompt, a custom color scheme for your development environment, or a plethora of keyboard shortcuts. Your learners won’t have any of this, so try to create an environment that mirrors what they do have. Some teachers create a separate bare-bones account on their laptop or a separate teaching-only account if they’re using an online service like Scratch or GitHub.

#### Use the Screen Wisely

You will usually need to enlarge your font considerably for people to read it from the back of the room, which means you canTo manage this, maximize the window you are using to teach and then ask everyone to give you a thumbs-up or thumbs-down on its readability. Use a black font on a lightly-tinted background rather than a light font on a dark background — the light tint will glare less than pure white. put much less on the screen than you’re used to.

If you can get a second projector and screen, use it: the extra real estate will allow you to display your code on one side and its output or behavior on the other. If second screen requires its own computer, ask a helper to control it rather than hopping back and forth between two keyboards.

Finally, if you are teaching something like the Unix shell in a console window, it’s important to tell people when you run an in-console text editor and when you return to the console prompt.

#### Draw Early, Draw Often

Diagrams are always a good idea. I sometimes have a slide deck full of ones that I have prepared in advance, but building diagrams step by step helps with retention and allows you to improvise.

#### Avoid Distractions

Turn off any notifications you may use on your laptop, especially those from social media. Seeing messages flash by on the screen distracts you as well as your learners, and it can be awkward when a message pops up you’d rather not have others see.

#### Improvise — After You Know The Material

Stick fairly closely to the lesson plan you’ve drawn up or borrowed the first time you teach a lesson. It may be tempting to deviate from the material because you would like to show a neat trick or demonstrate another way to do something, but there is a fair chance you’ll run into something unexpected that will cost you more time than you have.

Once you are more familiar with the material, though, you can and should start improvising based on the backgrounds of your learners, their questions in class, and what you personally find most interesting.

#### Face the Screen — Occasionally

It’s OK to face the projection screen occasionally when you are walking through a section of code or drawing a diagram: not looking at a roomful of people who are all looking at you can help lower your anxiety levels and give you a moment to think about what to say next.

You shouldn’t do this for more than a few seconds at a time, though. A good rule of thumb is to treat the projection screen as one of your learners: if it would be uncomfortable to stare at someone for as long as you are spending looking at the screen, it’s time to turn around and face your class again.

#### Drawbacks

Live coding does have some drawbacks, but they can all be avoided or worked around with a little bit of practice. If you find that you are making too many trivial typing mistakes, set aside five minutes every day to practice typing: it will help your day-to-day work as well. If you think you are spending too much time referring to your lesson notes, break them into smaller pieces so that you only ever have to think about one small step at a time.

### [Lesson Study](http://teachtogether.tech/en/index.html#s:performance-jugyokenkyu)

The assumption that some people are born teachers is wrong: instead, like any other performance art, the keys to better teaching are practice and collaboration. As [[Gree2014](http://teachtogether.tech/en/index.html#ref-Gree2014)] explains, the Japanese approach to this is called [jugyokenkyu](http://teachtogether.tech/en/index.html#g:jugyokenkyu), which means “lesson study”:

>In order to graduate, [Japanese] education majors not only had to watch their assigned master teacher work, they had to effectively replace him, installing themselves in his classroom first as observers and then, by the third week, as a wobbly…approximation of the teacher himself. It worked like a kind of teaching relay. Each trainee took a subject, planning five days’ worth of lessons… [and then] each took a day. To pass the baton, you had to teach a day’s lesson in every single subject: the one you planned and the four you did not… and you had to do it right under your master teacher’s nose. Afterward, everyone—the teacher, the college students, and sometimes even another outside observer—would sit around a formal table to talk about what they saw.

But continuous feedback isn’t part of teaching culture in most English-speaking countries. There, what happens in the classroom stays in the classroom: teachers don’t watch each other’s lessons on a regular basis, so they can’t borrow each other’s good ideas.

*Jugyokenkyu* works because it maximizes the opportunity for unplanned knowledge transfer between teachers: someone sets out to demonstrate X, but while watching them, their audience actually learns Y as well (or instead). For example, a teacher might intend to show learners how to search for email addresses in a text file, but what their audience might take away is some new keyboard shortcuts.

### [Giving and Getting Feedback on Teaching](http://teachtogether.tech/en/index.html#s:performance-feedback)

![Feedback feelings](img/deathbulge-jerk.jpg)

Feedback is easier to give and receive when both parties share expectations about what is and isn’t in scope and about how comments ought to be phrased. If you are the person asking for feedback:

* **Initiate feedback.** It’s better to ask for feedback than to receive it unwillingly.
* **Choose your own questions,** i.e. ask for specific feedback. It’s a lot harder for someone to answer, “What do you think?” than to answer either, “Was I speaking too quickly?” or , “What is one thing from this lesson I should keep doing?”.
* **Use a feedback translator.** Have someone else read over all the feedback and give you a summary. It can be easier to hear, “Several people think you could speed up a little,” than to read several notes all saying, “This is too slow” or, “This is boring.”
* **Be kind to yourself.** Many of us are very critical of ourselves, so it’s always helpful to jot down what we thought of ourselves before getting feedback from others. That allows us to compare what we think of our performance with what others think, which in turn allows us to scale the former more accurately.

You can give feedback to others more effectively as well:

* **Interact.** Staring at someone is a good way to make them feel uncomfortable, so if you want to give feedback on how someone normally teaches, you need to set them at ease. Interacting with them the way that a real learner would is a good way to do this, so ask questions or (pretend to) type along with their example.
* **Balance positive and negative feedback.** The “compliment sandwich” made up of one positive comment, one negative, and a second positive becomes tiresome pretty quickly, but it’s important to tell people what they should keep doing as well as what they should change.
* **Take notes.** You won’t remember everything you noticed if the presentation lasts longer than a few seconds, and you definitely won’t recall how often you noticed them. Make a note the first time something happens and then add a tick mark when it happens again so that you can sort your feedback by frequency.

Taking notes is more efficient when you have some kind of rubric so that you’re not scrambling to write your observations while the person you’re observing is still talking. The simplest rubric for free-form comments from a group is a 2x2 grid whose vertical axis is labeled “what went well” and “what can be improved”, and whose horizontal axis is labeled “content” (what was said) and “presentation” (how it was said).

![Teaching rubric](img/2x2-rubric.png)

### [How to Practice Performance](http://teachtogether.tech/en/index.html#s:performance-practice)

The best way to improve your in-person lesson delivery is to watch yourself do it:

* Work in groups of three.
* Each person rotates through the roles of teacher, audience, and videographer. The teacher has 2 minutes to explain something. The person pretending to be the audience is there to be attentive, while the videographer records the session using a cellphone or other handheld device.
* After everyone has finished teaching, the whole group watches the videos together. Everyone gives feedback on all three videos, i.e. people give feedback on themselves as well as on others.
* After the videos have been discussed, they are deleted. (Many people are justifiably uncomfortable about images of themselves appearing online.)
* Finally, the whole class reconvenes and adds all the feedback to a shared 2x2 grid of the kind described above without saying who each item of feedback is about.
